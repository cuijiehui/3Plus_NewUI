ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From OneKeyShare:
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
From ShareSDK:
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In ShareSDK:
* AndroidManifest.xml => shareSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => shareSDK\src\main\assets\
* libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.3.12.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.3.12.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.3.12.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.3.12.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.3.12.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.3.12.jar
* res\ => shareSDK\src\main\res\
* src\ => shareSDK\src\main\java\
In OneKeyShare:
* AndroidManifest.xml => oneKeyShare\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => oneKeyShare\src\main\assets\
* libs\mframework.jar => oneKeyShare\libs\mframework.jar
* res\ => oneKeyShare\src\main\res\
* src\ => oneKeyShare\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
